# DashCash Propsal

One-time-use physical Dash wallets.

### Overview

As things stand today, there is no way for someone to exchange cryptocurrencies without incurring a fee. With cash, if I have it, I can give it to someone else, and not pay anything for the transaction. DashCash is an attempt to bring the same frictionless transactions we have with cash to cryptocurrencies.
